# malikwamali
This was a personal projecy undertaken during my time in internal attachment at university.
It is an ecommerce website where students of Dedan Kimathi University can resell and buy furniture
The website was developed using HTML, CSS and PHP.
Due to most free cloud hosting sites only supporting static web pages, I have been unable to host effectively.
To work around this, I would encourage anyone who would want to view it to install a local server on their machine. The database files have been provided under "malikwamali database" and the sql required to import the database has been provided as "import sql database".
All files have been provided and would require running them in the htdocs section of the server directly. This is encouraged due to the file paths for various links as well uploadds.
Thank you. Have a nice time.
